## INTRODUCTION
In order to describe queuing problems through mathematical formulation, some assumptions are made by considering arrivals and service as patterned by known function. Equations representing the distribution of the time between arrivals are used with other equations depicting other features such as the distribution of the service time. The relationship existing between these equations is the matter studied in waiting line theory. Arrivals of people or entry requirements (events) are customarily Poisson distributed. The duration of the service provided by people is usually exponentially distributed.

## SINGLE-CHANNEL QUEUING PROBLEMS

Single-station or single-channel queuing problem is the name applied on those problems in which only one unit (station) is delivering the service as illustrated in Fig. 1, where circles represent the arrival elements (events) and a square represents a station which contains an element being serviced.

## Poisson Distribution

Poisson random variable is typically used to model the number of times an event happened in a time interval. For example, the number of users visited on a website in an interval can be thought of a Poisson process. Poisson distribution is described in terms of the rate (μ) at which the events happen. An event can occur 0, 1, 2, … times in an interval. The average number of events in an interval is designated λ (lambda). Lambda is the event rate, also called the rate parameter. The probability of observing k events in an interval is given by the equation:

## Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It has a parameter λ called rate parameter, and its equation is described as :
